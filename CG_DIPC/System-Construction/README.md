# System Construction

The FLOPSS pipeline starts with constructing the system in which you are studying the phase separation.


For this tutorial, we will be constructing a ternary lipid bilayer that we investigate, consisting of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dilinoleyl-phosphatidylcholine (DIPC), and cholesterol (CHOL), at a molar ratio of 0.42:0.28:0.3. We will be creating a small bilayer patch with 324 total lipids hydrated with water (with a lipid: real water ratio of 1:30).

The following steps will walk you through on how to construct a lipid bilayer patch from scratch using [CHARMMGUI Martini Maker](https://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=input/martini.bilayer) Tool.
